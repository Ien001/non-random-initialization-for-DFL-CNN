# non random initialization for DFL-CNN
Hi there,  
In this work, I'm sharing my reimplementation for `non-random-initialization` for DFL-CNN, which is a part of the paper "Learning a Discriminative Filter Bank within a CNN", just move on to `main.py`.
  
I also reimplemented `Resnet based DFL-CNN`, just check out `DFL.py`.  
  
Still, there are some issues worth discussing, like "why a special initialization for a certain layer of CNN is able to affect the ultimate categorization result?"

Thanks for @songdejia's work in reimplementing DFL-CNN, I cannot do this without his/her pervious contribution!  
  
If you have any question, plz tell me through issue.☺️  
  
Best,  
Ian
